# Research and Backtesting of Technical Trading Strategies

This is a personal project that incorporates Zach LÃ»ster's aka [kernc](https://github.com/kernc/backtesting.py) backtesting.py 
to backtest technical trading strategies. The objective is to create an organized system to backtest strategy ideas and analyze 
the results as efficiently as possible.
